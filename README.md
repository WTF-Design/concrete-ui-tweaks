## Changelog
1.2.20240202
- Use an embedded SVG of the Concrete CMS logo as the login button as not to depend on version specific paths. Very old Concrete installs don't have the icon where 8/9 puts it. Also, the SVG doubles as the user script icon for clear visual distinction inside user script host extensions with the added benefit of giving us a more polished look.

Lando logo is the property of [PortlandLabs](https://www.portlandlabs.com/) and is embedded in and used from the user script meta data block in order to keep things as lean and self-contained as possible.
